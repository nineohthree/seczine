# About
This repository is a clone of clippng's original etherpad instance. The project has not been
updated in a month and I have taken the liberty to clone the text here for anyone to use, along
with the possible chance that the project might again become active, allowing for active 
development again. All names, aliases, emails and other identifying information has been redacted
for those that have not explicitly made the choice to publicize them.
